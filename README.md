🍦 Ice Cream Sales & Trend Analysis (2019)


Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a 2019 ice cream sales dataset to identify consumer behavior patterns, product popularity, and external environmental influences on revenue. This analysis was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Key Questions Addressed:

Flavor Popularity: Which flavors moved the highest volume of units?

Environmental Impact: How does daily temperature correlate with total sales?

Temporal Trends: Do weekends and holidays see a significant spike in revenue compared to weekdays?

Data Gaps: Identifying missing variables (like customer retention data) to improve future profitability.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning: Used logical IF and OR functions to categorize 366 daily entries into "Weekend" and "Weekday" segments.

Statistical Analysis: Calculated averages (Weekday: $104.19 vs. Weekend: $105.69) and identified a positive correlation between high temperatures and sales growth.

Data Visualization: Created scatter plots to visualize the linear relationship between weather patterns and revenue.

Business Communication: Translated raw data into actionable insights for inventory and marketing stakeholders.

Core Insights

Weather-Driven Revenue: Sales consistently increased as temperatures rose, specifically exceeding $60.00 on days over 80°F.

Weekend Performance: Weekend sales averaged $105.69, slightly higher than the weekday average of $104.19.

Strategic Recommendation: Businesses should optimize inventory deliveries for Friday afternoons to capitalize on the combined effect of warmer weekend temperatures.

Data Limitations: 

The current dataset lacks specific pricing and revenue data, limiting popularity measures to unit volume.

Customer retention data was unavailable, preventing an analysis of new vs. returning customer profitability
